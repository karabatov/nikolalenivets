/**
 * SKUTouchPresenter allows you to demo your app to an audience and have
 * them follow your touches. It displays a dot (or multiple dots) wherever
 * the screen is touched. You can configure the dot's color and opacity,
 * and you can also have the dot(s) appear only when the device is
 * mirroring to a second display via AirPlay or an adapter cable.
 *
 * Install via Cocoapods or manually (see the README for more details).
 *
 * **Important:** SKUTouchPresenter recognizes touches by acting as a
 * custom subclass of UIApplication. If your app already uses a custom
 * subclass of UIApplication, then you should edit SKUTouchPresenter.h
 * and change the superclass from UIApplication to the name of your
 * custom subclass (so the inheritance chain is UIApplication ->
 * YourApplicationSubclass -> SKUTouchPresenter).
